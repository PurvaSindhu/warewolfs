microsystems. its also known as platforn independent. java consists of JDK(JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT),
(JAVA DEVELOPMENT KIT),JRE(java run time environment),AND JVM(java virtual machine).

whatwhat is WORA,platform independent and .class file diagram
WORA is write once run anywhere.
*platform independent : once the byte code is obtained after compilation,by using this byte 
cobe we can run the program in any operating systems like linex,mac and windows.
*.class : the byte code is also known as .class files,the .class file is obtained 
during the compilation time using the command javac.

types of data types
there are two types of data types
primitive               non-premitive 
int,char,byte           string 
long,boolean,           arrays
float,double            costom data types

explain 10 key words
int used to save numbers 
char used to store a single character
boolean :to cheak the given args true or false
float :used to store the decimal upto 7decimal points
double :used to store the decimal upto  15 decimal points
string :used to save sequence of characters
byte:used to store small size numbers -128 to 127
arrays : used to store similar set of data types
new: used to create instance of class
public: access specifier

explain switch case wit example
public static void main(String [] args){
		int numberOfClasses=5;
		String nameOfClass="class 5";
		switch numberOfClasses;
		
		case 1:nameOfClass="class1";
		break;
		case 2:nameOfClass="class2";
		break;
		case 3:nameOfClass="class3";
		break;
		case 4:nameOfClass="class4";
		break;
		case 5:nameOfClass="class5";
		break;
		
		default: "no class";
		
		System.out.println("this is class"+nameOfClass);
		}
	}
 
 this chaining
 class reference name{
    public int number;
	public String name;
	
 }
